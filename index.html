            <p>This is some text describing what I do, my career, experience and hobbies. There will be some pictures
                added below this text. I should add a picture of myself as well, perhaps to the upper
                left or inside the big picture or to the left of this text. There are more useful pics under the folder
                /assets. I should mention that this website was done as part of an HTML/CSS school project. After it's
                done I intend to publish it on GitHub pages. </p>
